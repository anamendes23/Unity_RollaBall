First unity tutorial on the learning session.

This tutorial teaches about Rigidbody and using physics to move the player.
It's also a good start to learn about Unity's coordinate axes and views.

Furthermore, you'll learn about prefabs, make a body rotate, colliders and how to make an object self-destroy after being
touched (collected) by the player.
